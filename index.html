            <p class="fst-italic" style="text-align:justify;">
Canuckle is a fun and engaging word-guessing game created especially for Canadians. If you've ever played Wordle, you'll find the concept familiar but with a uniquely Canadian twist. Every word in the game is directly related to Canada, whether it's geography, culture, or slang.

<br>Unlike games like Lewdle that use adult words, Canuckle keeps it clean and suitable for all ages. The gameplay is simple yet challenging: you must guess a five-letter word within six attempts. Each guess brings you closer to the solution as you identify correct letters and their placements. That's what makes the Canuckle word game so exciting, it's a brain teaser with a patriotic flavor!
